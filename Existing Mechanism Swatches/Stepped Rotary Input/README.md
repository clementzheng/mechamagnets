## 3D printing
* All STL files were printed with a [Cetus 3D Printer](https://www.cetus3d.com/).
* Filament used: [Polymaker Polylite PLA](http://www.polymaker.com/shop/polylitetrade/)
* Printer settings:
  * Layer height: **0.25mm**
  * Infill: **15%**
  * Quality: **Normal**
  * Raft but no supports

**Note:** the disassembled image illustrates the part orientation for 3D printing (i.e. which face contacts the bed).
