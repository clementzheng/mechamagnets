# Existing Mechanism Swatches

These different swatches attempt to replicate the look, feel and function of existing input mechanisms. They are currently customizable as [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) parametric models. Each folder contains the STL files for 3D printing and its corresponding bill of materials and settings.
