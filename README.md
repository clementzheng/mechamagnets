## Work in progress

* **Customizable Tactile Swatches**
  - Swatches for different mechanisms with variable tactile reponses.
* **Tactile characterization for Mechamagnets**
  - Characterization of different embedded magnet configurations and their impact on mechanical and perceptual tactile feedback.
  - Parameters: 
    - distance between
    - incident angle
    - separation between
    - magnet strength
    - magnet shape
